            <p> The <b>Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a <a href=""> domesticated junglefowl</a> species, with
                attributes of wild species such as the <a href=""> grey </a> and the <a href=""> Ceylon junglefowl
                </a><sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup> that
                are originally from <a href="">Southeast Asia</a>. <b> Rooster </b>and <b> cock </b> are terms for adult
                male birds, and a younger male may be called a <b>cockerel</b>. A male that has been <a href="">
                    castrated </a> is a <a href=""> capon</a>. An adult female bird is called a <b>hen</b>, and a
                sexually immature female is called a
                <b>pullet</b>. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their <a href=""> meat
                </a> and <a href=""> eggs</a>) or as <a href=""> pets</a>. Traditionally they were also bred for
                <a href="">cockfighting</a> , which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat
                are
                <a href=""> broilers </a> and for eggs are <a href=""> layers</a>.
            </p>
            <p> Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
                billion as of 2018,<sup><a href="">[2]</a></sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more
                chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth,
                folklore and religion, and in language and literature.</p>
            <p> Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia,
                and East Asia, <sup><a href="">[3]</a></sup> but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle
                East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the
                Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that
                gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the
                annals of Thutmose III. <sup><a href="">[4][5][6]</a></sup> They are known in ancient Greece from the
                5th century BC. <sup><a href="">[7][8]</a></sup></p>

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
                century
                as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely
                used
                throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken
                (*manuk) is
                part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages). Chickens, together
                with
                dogs
                and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture,[26] the first Neolithic culture of
                Oceania.[27]

            <h2>Biology and habitat</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Chickens are omnivores.[31] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and
                even
                animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[32] or sometimes young mice.[33] The average chicken may live
                for
                5–10 years, depending on the breed.[34] The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to
                Guinness
                World Records.[35]</p>

            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <hr>
            <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
            <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
                incubation of
                eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking
                order,
                with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or
                roosters
                from
                a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established.
                Adding
                hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed]
            </p>
            <h4>Vocalizations</h4>
            <p>When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high
                pitch
                as
                well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call
                their
                chicks and encourage them to eat.</p>
            <h4>Crowing</h4>
            <p>Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow
                as
                well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a
                rooster.[citation
                needed]</p>
            <h4>Courtship</h4>
            <p>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often
                lowering
                the wing which is closest to the hen.[45] The dance triggers a response in the hen[45] and when she
                responds
                to
                his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.</p>

                <li>Male approaching the hen</li>
                <li>Male pre-copulatory waltzing</li>
                <li>Male waltzing</li>
                <li>Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate)
                </li>
                <li>Male mounting</li>
                <li>Male treading with both feet on hen's back</li>
                <li>Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[46]</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Nesting and laying behaviour</h4>
            <p>Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from
                neighbouring
                nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred
                locations,
                rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a preference to lay in the
                same
                location. Two or more hens may try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small or one
                of
                the
                hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There
                is
                evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.[47]</p>
